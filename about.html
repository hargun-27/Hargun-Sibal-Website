                                    Hey there! My name is Hargun Sibal and I’m a Second Year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada 🛠️! I have had a passion for learning more about technology and how I can create a meaningful impact in whatever way I can - through side projects, clubs, design teams, or even working at my most recent co-op.

                                    <br><br>

                                    Something that makes me who I am is my drive for learning and never giving up. Surprisingly I learned this trait from one of my favorite anime characters which happens to be Naruto Uzumaki 🍜.

                                    <br><br>

                                    Aside from the school grind and anime, I love playing sports from Ultimate Frisbee to Baseball— I’m always down for some friendly competition 🥏. This year I was part of an Ultimate Frisbee intramural team, but I’m really looking forward to trying out for the school’s Varsity team soon 😎. I also found a whole new interest in Skateboarding with my friends! It's really been a great way to relax from the stress of school and spend time with my friends 🛹.

                                    <br><br>

                                    I’m also involved in a few unique extracurriculars at UWaterloo. I am an Engineering Ambassador ⚙️, where I volunteer my time to help give prospective students a personal and informative connection to Waterloo Engineering. I was also the Software Team Lead for the SYDE Class profile where I led a group of 7 peers to help give an insight into our first-year experiences to incoming students. 
                                    
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    During co-op, when things are slightly more relaxed than in school, I get to join my local Bhangra team once again 🕺. Bhangra has played a huge role in my life and I am so glad that I found a meaningful way to express myself! You can check out some small performances <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSQ7ZbLMM17kP7LzgW7ECMw" target="_blank">here</a>!

                                    <br><br>

                                    Just for fun, you can also check out a Youtube Channel my friends and I started called <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@poggywoggyuw" target="_blank">Poggy Woggy</a> where we document our university experiences to share with everyone else 😍. I am very glad and thankful for the friends and also opportunities that I have had on my journey throughout university so far, and I can't wait to make some more along the way!

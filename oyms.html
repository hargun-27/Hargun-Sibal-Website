                            This was not only mine, but my groups first official website and our first
                            experience with Front End Development. We were all quite familiar with Web Development
                            from our grade 10, 11, and 12 Computer Engineering classes, however this was our first
                            attempt
                            at creating a website for someone else that was going to be published to the internet.
                            Due to this being our first official website (definitely not our last), it was
                            very rewarding seeing that the product turned out amazing which made the whole process much
                            more
                            rewarding and so much more satisfying. Our hardwork paid off and the struggles we faced
                            definitetly helped us learn a lot!

                            <b>First Struggle:</b>
                            <br>
                            I have used HTML and CSS in the past to create static websites. This was my first website where 
                            I wanted to make sure that there were interactive user experiences simply because the user will be inputting their
                            information to stay updated with OYMS. In order for this to be a reality, I needed to know JavaScript. This is where the struggle began
                            for me because I have never learned JavaScript before, but I wasn't going to let that stop me. I watched countless YouTube videos and tutorials
                            to help understand how to connect the user information that they input in the website, to a spreadsheet that the youth organization can access
                            to get a list of emails that they can use for themselves. <br><br>Although the code that I created was not overly complex, it was still an adjustment for myself
                            simply because I was learning this language on the spot in a few hours. I was very proud and happy once I saw that the user information was connected and 
                            sent to the spreadsheet, it was the best feeling ever!  
                        </p>

                            <br>
                            Being one of the inviduals in charge of the design and layout of the website, I knew that I did not want to disappoint
                            the user, but also the youth organization because they asked US, a group of 5 students, to code and plan how their website
                            will be layed out. There was a bit of pressure to make sure the design we created was not only consistent to their previous
                            work, but also something that had the user experience in mind. We struggled with coming out with a solid solution on what the website
                            would look like, but looking at some examples online, going through a few videos on Web Development and UI/UX we overcame the struggle by
                            using Figma to help layout our whole design. 
                            <br><br>
                            To create a website that would help educate others and also gain more traffic,
                            we needed to create an efficient and intuitive UI.
                            It should be very easy to see all the information, interactive, and also have many animations to enhance the user experience.

                        <p>We began with creating a repository on Github and set deadlines for each of us to make sure we were on top of everything.
                            We each had something to work on before the deadline. 
                            We also decided on what our final website should look like and what it would accomplish for the future. The list included:
                        <ol class="list">
                            <li>User is able to enter their information, and it is stored somewhere safely</li>
                            <li>Smooth and clean animations, colors, and fonts are consistent on all pages</li>
                            <li>Create a feature where future blogs, podcasts, or videos will automatically be updated on the website - still working on it :)</li>

                            I worked on helping out where I can, the splash page, all the user input tasks, and the whole event page (a small video is linked at the bottom for this part). You can also see a few small screenshots below:

                        <p>Now that the website has been published to the internet, in the future I’d like to implement
                            a lot more features to further enhance the user experience prior as I learn more about
                            JavaScript and design elements.
                            These features are:</p>
                        <ol class="list">
                            <li>Adding a dark theme to the website</li>
                            <li>Creating more animations simply to make the user experience as impactful as possible</li>
                            <li>Adding more interactive aspects</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Overall, I am very glad that I was given this opportunity to work on the website along side
                            my friends! Simply having the luxury of using my own ideas and designing a UI that fit my
                            vision was definitly a bonus!
